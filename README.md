# Expenses app challenge

This project makes use of this [API](https://github.com/pleo-io/frontend-challenge/tree/master/api).

## To run this project

-   Clone both this repo and the repo for the [API](https://github.com/pleo-io/frontend-challenge/tree/master/api)
-   Start the API locally - instructions can be foun in it's [README](https://github.com/pleo-io/frontend-challenge/tree/master/api))
-   Make a copy of the .env-example file found in the root of this repo and rename it to .env
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `npm start`

## Notes on this project:

-   I started this project using a [basic react boilerplate](https://github.com/MareliBasson/react-boilerplate-site) I've created before and updated as required.
-   Setting up the API functionality is something I haven't done on my own before.
-   Part of my boilerplate is using absolute paths - I find it a lot neater to navigate but also much easier to update if a component's location changes.
-   I used my favourite budget app as a guideline for the UI: [22Seven](https://www.22seven.com/)
